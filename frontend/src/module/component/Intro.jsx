          This system utilizes an machine learning model to make predictions of HABs in the Gulf of Mexico. 
          In addition it also provides historical instances of HABs in that area. 
          Users can either search by past dates or select an area in the gulf to see predictions up to two days in advance.

          This project was created as part of our Graduate Capstone at Kean University. 
          Our aim is to develop and implement a software system that shows historical information and predictions of Harmful Algae Blooms (HABs) 
          along the US coast of the Gulf of Mexico with a precision rate of at least 80%.

        <p className='Intro-content'>
          Harmful Algal Bloom (HABs) of the algae Karenia Brevis, happen seasonally in the Gulf of Mexico under similar circumstances from roughly August to December. 
          This algae releases a neurotoxin into the water it inhabits when it dies, poisoning the ocean life in the area making it unfit for human consumption. 
          This causes these blooms to be particularly damaging, both to peopleâ€™s health and the economic viability of the areas they occur. 
          We hope that the severity predictions displayed on this system will help people avoid areas where blooms are occurring.
